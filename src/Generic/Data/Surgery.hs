-- | Surgery for generic data types:
-- remove and insert constructors and fields.
--
-- Functions in this module are expected to be used with visible type
-- applications. Surgeries have a lot of type parameters, but usually only the
-- first one to three type arguments need to be passed via @TypeApplications@.
-- Functions are annotated with \"functional dependencies\", with a meaning
-- similar to the homonymous GHC extension for type classes (click on
-- \"Details\" under each function to see those).
--
-- Note that not all parameters to the left of a functional dependency arrow
-- need to be annotated explicitly to determine those on the right. Some can
-- also be inferred from the context.
